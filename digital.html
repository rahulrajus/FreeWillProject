                “Digital: A Love Story” by Christine Love is an interactive visual novel where the user can participate in conversations on various messaging boards called BBSs. On these message boards, the reader has the option to open whichever notifications he or she wants. Some messages provide useful information on how the reader can progress through the story, such as codes and channel numbers that allow the user to dial into more message boards. The main element of the game is centered around the user’s messages to and from a girl on one of the BBSs named Emilia. The main storyline progresses as the user responds and develops a relationship with her. However, the user has the opportunity to explore a variety of message boards, each of which giving the user a myriad of random, unrelated posts to view, from messages warning against computer viruses to messages that argue that everyone in the world should learn Japanese.

                Due to the vast number of options in terms of choices that the user can make, the piece gives the reader a sense of authority in the course of the story. The reader chooses which BBS to go to, which messages to open, which messages to reply to, and what order to do all of these actions in. However, this wide array of choices gives the user nothing more than the mere illusion of free will. Although the reader decides what actions happen when, the story is still linear and can only follow down one single path. The user is presented with a vast amount of options to give a fake sense of free will, when in reality, the plot only progresses once the user has taken some specific action.

                Despite all the random options, the main storyline is truly about the reader’s relationship with Emilia, and if he or she does not chose to open and respond to her messages, the literature will remain stagnant. In theory, the piece could never end if the user never clicks on the correct options. Since there is a true “correct” way to play the game, the whole idea of free will is essentially destroyed. The user is led to believe they have full autonomy over what happens, as they sit back and read about why the entire world should learn the new super-language, Japanese; however, in reality, reading the random posts has no effect on the story whatsoever. The user cannot control which direction the story goes in; the only aspect the user truly has full control over is the speed at which he or she can progress towards the ending of the game, an ending predetermined long before the release of the game and reliant only upon the creator’s intent.
