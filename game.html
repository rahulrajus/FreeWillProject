                In this electronic literature selection, the reader is obligated to maneuver through conventional gamemaps to reach the final level: heaven. With no shortage of distractions, the author assaults the reader with animations, loud monotonous noise, video pop-ups, and obscurely placed text. These diversions restrict the character from obtaining salvation. To some, religion is forced down throats with flashy door-to-door advertising, sugar-coated lies, and persecution by the hand of a white male holding his large cross. The reader is forced to comply or die. Any nonconforming thought is deemed as sin and the avatar is returned to the origin of the level. Followers are subject to biblical constraints but are conclusively greeted with the ending of a drunken rant and disobedient child. The forced religion did not save the reader from sin. The very ideal the followers tirelessly attempted to avoid stood in the endgame with an extended hand. “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game” eludes to the fact that all paths of life convene to the same result; therefore, life itself lacks free will. The reader cannot utilize free will since the pre programmed paths converge to an ultimate purpose unbeknownst to the stated individual. They are not given the option to choose an alternate pathway. Although the reader has control over the movement within the level (free will), they eventually must conform to progress through the game. The author’s jump-and-run interaction within Game, Game, Game, and Again Game is the largest margin of free will deception. With the outer border as the only visually defining limits, players assume every detail of the game is at their creative disposal.
