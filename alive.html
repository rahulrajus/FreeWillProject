                “With those We Love Alive” is a piece by Porpentine Charity Heartscape that creates a society wholly different from ours in which there is a gross empress and classes called urchins and rats. The piece is accompanied by eerie music playing in the background. There are magic spells and kids who roam the streets. The rat kids struggle to obtain their next meal and are often beat in the streets by police. The piece is dreary and seems to hone in with the player being a servant to an empress, helping focus on issues of poverty and child abuse, making the person reading appreciate their freedom and luxury, all impacted by the level of interactivity.

                This piece has a low level of real interactivity. This can be seen by the fact that in the first 12 clicks, there are three clicks of true decision making, and this is for something trivial: the name of the character, which never comes up again. From this point, there are six options of where you can go, all of which leave you in exactly the same place. This choice-making is to help the reader, who is a servant to the empress, share their talents with her. This series of interactivity links the reader to the message by giving the user first-hand experience that they have no control. The limit of power is to simulate a controlling abusive relationship in which the controlled person has control over only trivial things and no real choices. This lack of control can also be seen in the section of free-range choices that are seemingly by free will, but no choice makes any difference. This is to simulate the cyclical and negative pattern in controlling relationships in which all the choices by the abused are merely for show and make no real difference.
