                “Façade” by Michael Mateas & Andrew Stern is an indie AI video game that revolves around a young, wealthy couple. In the game, a user can say anything they want to the couple and the program is capable of parsing the input and continuing the story. The team figured out a way to develop a story without relying on typical narrative techniques that are based on complex story branches. Instead, it attempts to move the story forward based on the user’s input and context. This user input allows for the player to experience a multitude of different endings, drastically increasing the replay value, or desire to play the game again, but this variety of endings does have its limits. Since Mateas and Stern obviously did not predict every possible user scenario, it’s clear that the story does have a finite number of storylines. This is coupled with the fact that in the end the couple will always either get back together or the player will end up get kicked out. This piece of literature allows the reader a relatively large amount of free will regardless of whether we define free will as having unknown outcomes or if we define free will as having freedom to choose what we want to do.

                This level of free will and interactivity come from the fact that the user can input anything they would like combined with the fact that the effect that these comments will have on the characters in never known. While playing the game, these comments merely simulate reality, but when we look at what aspects of reality and free will are exaggerated or left out we can see the meaning behind the piece. The player is treated like a typical human in most aspects of free will, but there are only two main outcomes. This is the author's way of showing the world that we can change the outcome of what happens in this world, but we can only affect it by so much.
