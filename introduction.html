        <div id="content">
            <p>With the progression of mass produced technology from photo images to digital images to hyperlinks, “intertextuality as understood in terms of embedding and recycling of previous content, becomes part of a material reality that in turn opens the door for new cultural production that can be concretely measured in terms of its re-appropriation and constant reintroduction as a commodity” (Navas). The digital age introduces smartphones, computers, and gaming consoles as tangible items. These machines, although improve daily experiences, demonstrate the decrease in society’s free will. The codes and cookies direct the user on preprogrammed paths to view specific advertisements or websites. Authors of electronic literature have devised varying interactivity within different levels of gameplay to inform the public on their draining free will. This illusion of free will not only enhance the user’s experience, but strengthen the main argument behind these pieces of electronic literature as well.
                </p>
            <p>Interactivity is one of the main factors employed in electronic literature that heavily distinguishes it from traditional literature. Whereas authors of traditional texts cannot do much more than deliver their messages via the ink letters on pages, authors of electronic literature can take advantage of the new medium by enhancing their works with interactive elements to further portray their intents.
                </p>
            <p>As noted by Katherine Hayles, a variety of elements such as “visual displays, graphics, animations, and clever modifications of traditional literary devices” enable users to interact with electronic literature (Hayles). These effects allow the user to become integral to the progression of the story, as it will only move forward once the user completes a specific action. For example, Hayles argues that Emily Short’s piece entitled Savoir-Faire includes a whole new form of metaphors, which is only possible through electronic formats. In order for the storyline of Savoir-Faire to advance, the user must find the connection between a door and box. Opening the box will, in turn, open the door; this type of functional similarity as an “embodied metaphor” shows one of the many ways electronic literature can use interactivity to utilize traditional literary devices in a new medium.
                </p>
            <p>In addition to re-shaping classic literary devices to capitalize on the new abilities of electronic literature, interactivity also serves as a means for the user to feel more involved in the narration of the story. According to Janet Murray, these new forms of interactive electronic literature “enhance the narrative involvement by inviting readers/viewers to imagine themselves in the place of the creator.” Since interactive pieces allow readers to choose the story’s path, readers in turn become more invested in the plot, as they feel as though they had a part in the creation of the story and want to see their work come to fruition.

                </p>
            <p>This interactivity and thirst to be recompensed is based upon the human desire for free will. Free will is the opportunity to make a choice: for or against, while assuming to be the source of the decision (O’Connor and Franklin). In the realm of electronic literature, the reader is the focal point in the interaction with the electronic pieces; however, the reader cannot utilize free will since the pre-programmed paths converge to an ultimate purpose unbeknownst to the stated individual. They are not given the option to choose a different direction. The medium of a black screen constructs an illusion of free will.
                </p>
            <p>The four examples of literature have varying levels of eluded free will. These can be rated on a scale of how ergodic they are or the degree to which a “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.” (Hayles) The most structured and, therefore, least ergodic interaction is showcased in “With Those We Love Alive.” This piece is navigated using hypertexts, which take the user to further points in the story. This leaves the reader ultimately trapped and unsatisfied with their experience, representing abuse and lack of control that abusers force on their victims. The expanding hole of yearning for what ”should-be” created by the hypertext creates an argument within the piece that the abuse and forced path early on in life have repercussions felt later on, no matter how faint. The author utilizes this condensed technique to emphasize the oppression felt by those under the hand of others by connecting the links in infinite loops- always leading to the same finishing location.
                </p>
            <p>The next clicker based game is “Digital: A Love Story,” which has a trivial, but slightly less ergodic mode of moving through the game with very few options. The game manifests the illusion that the player has free will by giving the user a vast amount of messages. The reader can send out messages in varying orders; however, the pathways convene to the same conclusion. The true, predetermined ending symbolizes the overload of computers on our lives while also emphasizing how they improve society as a whole. They dictate all aspects of our lives including something as intimate as our love life and as temporary as our visual spectrum, but this negative side is juxtaposed with the survival of AI being necessary for society as a whole, even to the extent of destroying his love interest. The overall positive side to computers despite their flaws is argued using the lack of free will, with the forced closing of pop-ups showing how computers are invasive to our lives and the reader being forced to save AI in the end, every time, showing that it is essential for computers to keep advancing. This constant ending with varying approaches to it is similar to the next piece of electronic literature.
                </p>
            <p>Jason Nelson created “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game,” in which the character has a very set pathway, showing the total lack of free will in the gameplay, but the method of progressing through the levels is the most complex. This game shows the forced path of religion by emphasizing the path of life and how religious followers end up with the same sinful results: intoxication and misbehavior. The movement in the x-y plane is directly guided by boundaries, enemies, and incentives to eventually obtain the ultimate goal. This is regardless of the religious paths that we take in this life and the little control religion lends us, showcased in the game by the WASD controls.
                </p>
            <p>The lack of freedom felt in “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game” is contrasted by the variation in freedom in “Façade.” This game is our most ergodic piece and empowers the user to input any response they wish. This, while not being able to be programmed for all scenarios, greatly increases the amount of free will granted to the user. The free style is intended to mimic the real world. There are multiple outcomes in the game, and even though the player is ultimately resolving a conflict between a couple they still have great influence on the outcome. This is to illustrates everyone can change the world with their responses to it , but they will face repercussions.
                </p>
            <p>The electronic literature presented in this curation educate readers on the different ways technology can be used to manipulate our sense of free-will. Moreover, these examples exemplify how the technological components of interactivity can mask the loss of the user’s free will, while simultaneously reinforcing the author’s overarching purpose.
