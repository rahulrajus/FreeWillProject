            With technology of mass production from photo images to digital images to hyperlinks, “intertextuality as understood in terms of embedding and recycling of previous content, becomes part of a material reality that in turn opens the door for new cultural production that can be concretely measured in terms of its re-appropriation and constant reintroduction as a commodity” (Navas). The digital age is introducing  introduces smartphones, computers, and gaming consoles as tangible items. These machines, although they seem to generate new ideas, demonstrate the decrease in society’s free will. The codes and cookies direct the user on preprogrammed paths to view specific advertisements or websites. Authors of electronic literature have devised varying interactivity within different levels of gameplay to inform the public on their draining free will. This illusion of free will not only enhances the user’s experience, but strengthens the main argument behind these pieces of electronic literature, as well.

            Interactivity is one of the main factors employed in electronic literature that heavily distinguishes it from traditional literature. Whereas authors of traditional texts cannot do much more than deliver their messages via the ink letters on pages, authors of electronic literature can take advantage of the new medium by enhancing their works with interactive elements to further portray their intents.
            </p>
            <p>
            As noted by Katherine Hayles, a variety of elements such as “visual displays, graphics, animations, and clever modifications of traditional literary devices” enable users to interact with electronic literature (Hayles). These effects allow the user to become integral to the progression of the story, as because in many cases it will only go on move forward once the user does a specific action in many cases. For example, Hayles argues that Emily Short’s piece entitled Savoir-Faire includes a whole new form of metaphors that which are is only possible through electronic formats. In order for the storyline of Savoir-Faire to advance, the user must find the connection between a door and box., as oOpening the box will in turn open the door; this type of functional similarity as an “embodied metaphor” shows one of the many ways electronic literature can use interactivity to utilize traditional literary devices in a new medium (Hayles).

            In addition to re-shaping classic literary devices to capitalize on the new abilities of electronic literature, interactivity also serves as a means for the user to feel more involved in the narration of the story. According to Janet Murray, these new forms of interactive electronic literature “enhance the narrative involvement by inviting readers/viewers to imagine themself in the place of the creator” (Hayles?? Not sure how to cite this). Since interactive pieces allow the readers to choose the story’s path, the readers in turn becomes more invested in the plot, as they feel as if they had they have a part in the creation of the story and want to see if they succeeded in the end . their work come to fruition.

            Traditionally, free will is a mental battle between self-regulated morals and the parameters of societal norms. However, where is the critical point of choice in relation to the interactivity of gameplay? As should be clear from the historical survey, two common (and compatible) answers are: up to the individual in the sense that they are able to choose otherwise, or at minimum that they are able not to choose or act as they do, and up to the individual in the sense that she is the source of her action (O’Connor and Franklin). For the sake of the argument, the initial definition will be the defining trait of free will. In the realm of electronic literature, the reader is the focal point in the interaction with the electronic pieces. The reader cannot utilize free will, since the pre programmed paths converge to an ultimate purpose unbeknownst to the stated individual. They are not given the option to choose a different direction. The medium of a black screen constructs an illusion of free will.
            </p>
            <p>
            The four examples of literature have varying levels of eluded free will. These can be rated on a scale of how ergodic they are or the degree to which a “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.” (Hayles) We can rate our pieces of electronic literature on how ergodic they are. The most structured interaction is showcased in “With Those We Love Alive.” This piece is navigated using hypertexts, which take the user to further points in the story. Hyperlinks are the most trivial and superficial way to navigate electronic literature. The author utilizes this condensed technique to emphasize the helplessness of those under the hand of others, especially in abusive relationships, both friendly and romantic, by making the links loop to the same finishing location. This leaves the reader ultimately trapped and unsatisfied with their experience, representing abuse and lack of control that abusers force on their victims.
            The next clicker based game is “Digital: A Love Story,” which has a trivial, but slightly less ergodic mode of moving through the game with very few options. The game likes to create the illusion that the player is having free will by spamming the screen with a vast amount of pop-ups which the player must clear out. These pop-ups can be sorted out in different orders and are also tangentially relevant to the plotline. These create the illusion of free will and allow the reader to send out messages in varying orders, but this is merely an illusion of free will. The user is forced down the same pathway every time they play the game. The pop-ups creating the illusion of free will verses the true ending being predetermined is the author creating symbolism for the overload of computers on our lives, cramming our visual and love space, while also showing that there is one desired outcome: a happy life with someone else, shown by the ending of falling in love being the goal of the game every time the user plays. This constant ending with varying approaches to it is similar to the next piece of electronic literature.

             Jason Nelson created “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game,” in which the character has a very set pathway, showing the total lack of free will in the gameplay, but the method of getting to the end isn’t merely a superficial path. This is a game which seeks to show the forced path of religion, and it does so by emphasizing the path of life and how religious people end up with the same sinful results: intoxication and misbehavior. This is regardless of the religious paths that we take in this life and the little control religion lends us, symbolized in the game by the jumping up and moving to the sides. This freedom in small movement juxtaposed by the total lack of freedom in the linear nature symbolizes the freedom religion showcases and the lack of freedom it makes people live.
         </p>

            The lack of freedom felt in “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game” is contrasted by the variation in freedom in “Façade.” This game is our most ergodic piece and empowers the user to input any response they wish. This, while not being able to be programmed for all scenarios, greatly increases the amount of free will granted to the user. The free style is intended to mimic the real world. There are multiple outcomes in the game, and even though the player is ultimately resolving a conflict between a couple  they still have great influence on the outcome. This is to symbolize that everyone can change the world with their responses to it and that they can do anything they want, but they will face repercussions.

            Free will, illusion or not,  is characteristically human- it represents the idea that we are in control of our own destiny and future. Unfortunately, societal pressures and technology have inadvertently changed our interaction with free will.  The electronic literature presented in this curation serves to help readers understand the different ways technology can be used to manipulate our sense of free-will. 	Moreover, these examples exemplify how technological components can mask any loss in the user’s free will. In the end it is up to the reader to figure out how their decisions interact with the gameplay.
