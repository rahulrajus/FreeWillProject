        <div id="content">
            <p>With technology of mass production from photo images to digital images to hyperlinks, “intertextuality as understood in terms of embedding and recycling of previous content, becomes part of a material reality that in turn opens the door for new cultural production that can be concretely measured in terms of its re-appropriation and constant reintroduction as a commodity” (Navas). The digital age introduces smartphones, computers, and gaming consoles as tangible items. These machines, although they allow us to do new things, demonstrate the decrease in society’s free will. The codes and cookies direct the user on preprogrammed paths to view specific advertisements or websites. Authors of electronic literature have devised varying interactivity within different levels of gameplay to inform the public on their draining free will. This illusion of free will not only enhances the user’s experience, but strengthens the main argument behind these pieces of electronic literature, as well.
                </p>
            <p>Interactivity is one of the main factors employed in electronic literature that heavily distinguishes it from traditional literature. Whereas authors of traditional texts cannot do much more than deliver their messages via the ink letters on pages, authors of electronic literature can take advantage of the new medium by enhancing their works with interactive elements to further portray their intents.

            <p>As noted by Katherine Hayles, a variety of elements such as “visual displays, graphics, animations, and clever modifications of traditional literary devices” enable users to interact with electronic literature (Hayles). These effects allow the user to become integral to the progression of the story, as it will only move forward once the user does a specific action. For example, Hayles argues that Emily Short’s piece entitled Savoir-Faire includes a whole new form of metaphors, which is only possible through electronic formats. In order for the storyline of Savoir-Faire to advance, the user must find the connection between a door and box. Opening the box will, in turn, open the door; this type of functional similarity as an “embodied metaphor” shows one of the many ways electronic literature can use interactivity to utilize traditional literary devices in a new medium (Hayles).

            <p>In addition to re-shaping classic literary devices to capitalize on the new abilities of electronic literature, interactivity also serves as a means for the user to feel more involved in the narration of the story. According to Janet Murray, these new forms of interactive electronic literature “enhance the narrative involvement by inviting readers/viewers to imagine themself in the place of the creator” (Murray). Since interactive pieces allow readers to choose the story’s path, readers in turn become more invested in the plot, as they feel as though they had a part in the creation of the story and want to see their work come to fruition.

                </p>
            <p>This interactivity and desire to see their work come to fruition is based upon the human desire for free will. Free will is the ability to choose which decisions to make and avoid while feeling as if you are the source of these actions (O’Connor and Franklin). For the sake of the argument, this will be the definition of free will. In the realm of electronic literature, the reader is the focal point in the interaction with the electronic pieces. The reader cannot utilize free will, since the pre programmed paths converge to an ultimate purpose unbeknownst to the stated individual. They are not given the option to choose a different direction. The medium of a black screen constructs an illusion of free will.
                </p>
            <p>The four examples of literature have varying levels of eluded free will. These can be rated on a scale of how ergodic they are or the degree to which a “nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text.” (Hayles) The most structured and therefore least ergodic interaction is showcased in “With Those We Love Alive.” This piece is navigated using hypertexts, which take the user to further points in the story. Hyperlinks are the most trivial and superficial way to navigate electronic literature. The author utilizes this condensed technique to emphasize the helplessness of those under the hand of others, especially in abusive relationships, both friendly and romantic, by making the links loop to the same finishing location. This leaves the reader ultimately trapped and unsatisfied with their experience, representing abuse and lack of control that abusers force on their victims. This feeling of helplessness created by the hypertext creates an argument within the piece that the abuse and forced path early on in life have repercussions felt later on, no matter how faint.

                </p>
            <p>The next clicker based game is “Digital: A Love Story,” which has a trivial, but slightly less ergodic mode of moving through the game with very few options. The game likes to create the illusion that the player is having free will by giving the user a vast amount of messages which the player may read and reply to. These messages can be read and responded to in different orders and are also tangentially relevant to the plotline. These create the illusion of free will and allow the reader to send out messages in varying orders, but this is merely an illusion of free will. The user is forced down the same pathway every time they play the game. The myriad of different messages creating the illusion of free will while the true ending is predetermined symbolizes the overload of computers on our lives while also emphasizing how they improve society as a whole. They cram all aspects of our lives including something as extended as our love life and something as temporary as our visual spectrum, but this negative side is juxtaposed with the survival of AI being necessary for society as a whole, even to the extent of destroying his love interest. The overall positive side to computers despite their flaws is argued using the lack of free will, with the forced closing of pop-ups showing how computers are invasive to our lives and the reader being forced to save AI in the end, every time, showing that it is essential for computers to keep advancing. This constant ending with varying approaches to it is similar to the next piece of electronic literature.
                </p>
            <p>Jason Nelson created “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game,” in which the character has a very set pathway, showing the total lack of free will in the gameplay, but the method of getting to the end isn’t merely a superficial path. This is a game which seeks to show the forced path of religion, and it does so by emphasizing the path of life and how religious people end up with the same sinful results: intoxication and misbehavior. This is regardless of the religious paths that we take in this life and the little control religion lends us, symbolized in the game by the jumping up and moving to the sides. This freedom in small movement juxtaposed by the total lack of freedom in the linear nature symbolizes the freedom religion showcases and the lack of freedom it makes people live.
                </p>
            <p>The lack of freedom felt in “Game, Game, Game, and Again Game” is contrasted by the variation in freedom in “Façade.” This game is our most ergodic piece and empowers the user to input any response they wish. This, while not being able to be programmed for all scenarios, greatly increases the amount of free will granted to the user. The free style is intended to mimic the real world. There are multiple outcomes in the game, and even though the player is ultimately resolving a conflict between a couple they still have great influence on the outcome. This is to symbolize that everyone can change the world with their responses to it and that they can do anything they want, but they will face repercussions.
                </p>
            <p>Free will, illusion or not,  is characteristically human- it represents the idea that we are in control of our own destiny and future. Unfortunately, societal pressures and technology have inadvertently changed our interaction with free will.  The electronic literature presented in this curation serves to help readers understand the different ways technology can be used to manipulate our sense of free-will. Moreover, these examples exemplify how technological components can mask any loss in the user’s free will. In the end it is up to the reader to figure out how their decisions interact with the gameplay.
